## Description: This is the final peer-review assignment, (AKA Course Project 2)
## for Coursera's Exploratory Data Analysis class.
## URL of Data: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2FNEI_data.zip

## Please ensure this R script is in the same folder as the .rds files and
## that your working directory is set to that folder.

## Before starting my analysis, 
## I downloaded and unzipped the datasets and moved them to a new folder called
## EDA_Wk4Assignment. Next I opened SourceTree and created a new repository.
## Then I opened RStudio and started a new R Project for that folder.
## Now as I work on writing the script, I can save my progess to my GitHub.
